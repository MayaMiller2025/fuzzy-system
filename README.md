<h2> Ms Nelsons favorite color </h2>

<p> After a long discussion with ms nelson herself... i realized that her favorite color is NOT oramge!  It was a shocking surprise!  Quoted by her, "You know that bluish purple sunset color?  yeah thats my favorite color." </p>

<p> I yet to know which color is her exact favroite.  But i can only imagine ms nelson has great taste in her sunsets.  The first sunset i picture is something along the lines of this... </p>
